# Java 8 Learning

Based on https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-java-learn-java-8-features-by-coding-it/

# Why Java 8:
- Most popular and widely accepted language in the world.
- Java community wanted to introduce the `functional featutes` such as:
  - lambdas
  - streams
  - Optional etc
- To keep up with technological and advancements with mobiles/ laptops/ systems
- Simplify the concurrency operations

# Functional Programming:
- Embraces immutable object creation
- More concise and readable code
- Using functions methods as first class citizens
- Write code using `Declerative` approach

# Imperative vs Declarative programming:

## Imperative style of programming:
- Focuses on how to perform the operations
- Embraces object mutability
- Lists the step by step instructions on how to achieve an objective
- We write the code on what needs to be done in each step.
- Imperative style is used with classic object oriented programming.

## Declarative style of programming:
- Focuses on what is the result you want.
- Embraces object immutability
- Analogous to SQL
- Use te functions that are already part of the library to achieve an objective.
- Functional programming uses the declarative style of programming.
